# Fake-News-Prediction

• Developed a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake with an accuracy of 97% on the
test data.
• Implemented data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare the text data for analysis.
• Applied stemming and TF-IDF vectorization to convert the textual data into numerical features.
• Used logistic regression as the classification algorithm and evaluated the model’s performance using an
accuracy score.
• Created a predictive system that can classify new unseen news articles as real or fake.
